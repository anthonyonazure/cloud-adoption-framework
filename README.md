# cloud-adoption-framework

To be successful in adopting the cloud, a customer must prepare its people, technologies, and processes for this digital transformation. 

The cloud adoption framework (CAF) guides the customer through the cloud lifecycle journey.

The CAF is complex, this is a distilled version and with the steps organized in a different manner.

The CAF consists of six phases. The Govern and Manage phases run throughout the Ready to Organize phases.

Plan: When technical implementation is aligned with clear business objectives, it's much easier to measure and align success across multiple cloud implementation efforts, regardless of technical decisions.

Ready: Preparing the business, culture, people, and environment for coming changes leads to success in each effort and accelerates implementation and change projects.

Adopt: Ensure proper implementation of desired changes, across IT and business processes, to achieve business outcomes.

Migrate: Iterative execution of the cloud implementation methodology adhering to the tested process of Assess, Migrate, Optimize, and Secure & Manage to create a repeatable process for migrating workloads.

Innovate: Drive business value through innovation activities that unlock new technical skills and expanded business capabilities.

*Govern: Align corporate policy to tangible risks, mitigated through policy, process, and cloud-based governance tooling.

*Manage: Expand IT operations to ensure cloud-based solutions can be operated through secure, cost effective processes using modern, cloud-first operations tools.

Organize: Align people and teams to deliver proper cloud operations and adoption.


Typically the slides in these presentations has far more information then I would pack onto a slide, but wanted to ensure as much information as possbile was provided, I also make very liberal use of the notes section in each slide. I would suggest going through each deck enough time that you felt comfortable with the content and then remove the extra content from the slides before presenting the decks to a customer, but they could be presented as-is if you don't have the time to edit them.
